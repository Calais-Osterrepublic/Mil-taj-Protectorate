# Mil'taj Protectorate: Calais Fork
Hi I am NOT the original author of the Amalgamation plugin!

This plugin is initially meant to allow me to see the rest of the Mil'taj storyline, since I was observing an issue with going through the Prisoner missions.

In summary, the Prisoner exchange mission had a looping conversation point where there wasn't supposed to be, and the mod never allowed me to finish the Mil'taj storyline because the mod always registered "free quarg" where it shouldn't have.

Currently, the solution is very crude due to my lack of knowledge on Endless Sky and its plugins. I've hardly figured out how to wrangle Github.

So yes, my approach is very amateurish, and I wish to not diminish the original author's attempts.

Still, I will leave in the "recommended links" seen below. 

Thank you for your time.
