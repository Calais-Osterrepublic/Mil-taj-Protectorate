# Mil'taj Protectorate
Hi I am the original author of the Amalgamation plugin, while I have gotten back into Endless Sky recently my ideas of polish have changed greatly over these 4 years.

I decided that while I wasn't satisfied with Amalgamation as a whole, many of the outfits from plugins like Shields up were still interesting to me, and something I wanted in the game all these years later.

So rather than uploading a massive plugin that turns away many people by its sheer size again, I would upload this, a small quality of life plugin that adds many of the smaller outfits I personally believe make building ships more fun overall.

I am also working on an independent plugin for the Shields Up 'Mil'taj' race, since that was where I put the most effort and had the most interest when making Amalgamation back in the day.


This plugin contains the Mil'taj race placed in the right arm of the galaxy, they can be found by exploration or by doing the Remnant missions.

Reccomended Plugins:
